• Dar Es Salaam:  Urban Renewal 
CAMS has been asked by the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Human Settlement to develop high density housing solutions, along with commercial services, for 38 squatter sites in prime locations throughout Tanzania’s capital city Dar Es Salaam.  The goal is to revitalize the urban center by optimizing these prime sites whilst providing the land-rich, cash-poor tenants with legitimate assets in the form of high-density housing.
